# ROI Hunter Business Data – Public Feed (Updated)

This folder mirrors your existing GitHub Pages structure so you can overwrite the old files.

**Files included**
- `roi_hunter_business_data.csv` – updated data (ID column first)
- `index.html` – simple landing page linking to the CSV
- `.nojekyll` – prevents Jekyll processing

**Update steps (browser)**
1. Open your GitHub repository that serves your feed.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Drag the updated `roi_hunter_business_data.csv` (and `index.html` if you want the timestamp refreshed) into the upload area.
4. Click **Commit changes**.
5. Your Pages site will refresh shortly; the URL stays the same.

If your existing URL is:
```
https://<username>.github.io/roi-hunter-business-data/roi_hunter_business_data.csv
```
it will continue to work after the update.
